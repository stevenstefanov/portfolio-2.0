## Background

My goal at the end of this bootcamp is to get a position as a junior software developer. This project will help me showcase my learnings in React alongside some of the other projects I have worked on.

## Challenges

Learning React has been a joy but also a challenge. I can really see the potential there is and that really great things can be built using it, however the first few projects usng it have been a challenge.

## Learnings

Through this project, I got a lot more comfortable with React. I learned a lot about positioning, color styling and much more for spacing and design.


## Credits

Thank you to Columbia's Full-Stack Web Developer bootcamp for all the assistance and for teaching me all that I have learned.
